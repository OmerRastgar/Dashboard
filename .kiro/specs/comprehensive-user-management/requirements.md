# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes and enhances the existing React + FastAPI + SQL Server dashboard application to ensure all current functionality works properly, then adds comprehensive user management capabilities. This includes fixing existing user creation/editing, active/inactive toggles, proper audit logging for all actions, password management, role-based access control, and real-time dashboard updates. The system will provide a complete administrative interface for managing users, roles, permissions, and monitoring all system activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Existing User Management Features

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want all existing user management features to work properly, so that I can create, edit, activate/deactivate users and see proper audit logs for all actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks "Create User" button THEN the system SHALL display a working form to create new users
2. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL automatically log the creation action in audit logs
3. WHEN an administrator toggles a user's active/inactive status THEN the system SHALL update the database and log the status change
4. WHEN an administrator edits user information THEN the system SHALL save changes and create audit log entries
5. WHEN an administrator deletes a user THEN the system SHALL remove the user and log the deletion action
6. WHEN any user management action occurs THEN the dashboard user count SHALL update automatically
7. WHEN the user list is displayed THEN active/inactive status SHALL be clearly visible and functional

### Requirement 2: User Password Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user passwords including setting, resetting, and enforcing password policies, so that I can maintain secure access control for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new user THEN the system SHALL require a secure password that meets policy requirements
2. WHEN an administrator resets a user's password THEN the system SHALL generate a secure temporary password and log the action
3. WHEN a user's password expires THEN the system SHALL enforce password change on next login
4. IF a password fails policy validation THEN the system SHALL display specific policy requirements and reject the password
5. WHEN a password is changed THEN the system SHALL hash and store it securely using bcrypt or similar
6. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL create an audit log entry with timestamp and administrator details

### Requirement 3: Role-Based Access Control System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and assign roles with specific permissions to users, so that I can control what actions each user can perform in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a role THEN the system SHALL allow defining specific permissions for that role
2. WHEN a user is assigned a role THEN the system SHALL enforce the permissions associated with that role
3. WHEN a user attempts an action THEN the system SHALL verify the user has the required permission through their role
4. IF a user lacks permission for an action THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN roles are modified THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to all users with that role
6. WHEN a role is deleted THEN the system SHALL require reassignment of users currently holding that role

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Audit Logging and Tracking

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging of all user actions and system changes, so that I can track security events and maintain compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user performs an action THEN the system SHALL log the action with user ID, timestamp, IP address, and action details
2. WHEN a login attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL log success/failure with IP address and user agent
3. WHEN user data is modified THEN the system SHALL log the before and after values for changed fields
4. WHEN role assignments change THEN the system SHALL log the old role, new role, and administrator who made the change
5. WHEN password changes occur THEN the system SHALL log the event without storing the actual password
6. WHEN system settings are modified THEN the system SHALL log configuration changes with administrator details

### Requirement 5: Real-time Dashboard Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to automatically update when database changes occur, so that I always see current information without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data changes in the database THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically update user statistics within 5 seconds
2. WHEN new audit logs are created THEN the audit log viewer SHALL display new entries without page refresh
3. WHEN system metrics change THEN the dashboard charts SHALL update to reflect current values
4. WHEN a user is created, updated, or deleted THEN all connected dashboard instances SHALL receive the updates
5. IF the database connection is lost THEN the dashboard SHALL display a connection status indicator
6. WHEN database connection is restored THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically resume real-time updates

### Requirement 6: Advanced User Settings Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure user-specific settings and preferences, so that I can customize the user experience and enforce organizational policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses user settings THEN the system SHALL display all configurable user preferences
2. WHEN user settings are modified THEN the system SHALL validate settings against organizational policies
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL apply their personalized settings and preferences
4. IF settings conflict with security policies THEN the system SHALL enforce the more restrictive setting
5. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL log the change with administrator details
6. WHEN bulk settings updates are applied THEN the system SHALL process changes for multiple users simultaneously

### Requirement 7: System Health Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor system health and receive alerts for critical issues, so that I can maintain system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system resources exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and log the events
2. WHEN database performance degrades THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics on the dashboard
3. WHEN failed login attempts exceed limits THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts and log the events
4. IF critical system errors occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators
5. WHEN system backup processes run THEN the system SHALL log success/failure status
6. WHEN system maintenance is required THEN the dashboard SHALL display maintenance notifications to users
